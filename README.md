A mod that backports the features of Bundles of Bravery (1.21.2) to 1.20.1.

## Backported Features
- New Bundle UI
- Item Selection within Bundle
- Durability bar of bundle turns red when full
- Dyable bundles
- Updated bundle recipe
- Bundle Feature is now enabled by default so enabling it on world creation is not required

## Differences
- Bundle textures remain unchanged
- Selected item will be selected until an item is either removed or added to the bundle, at which point it will be reset
- When you scroll the bundle selection in the creative inventory it also scrolls the current tab (bug?)

## Credits
- Based on [Bundle Backport-ish](https://modrinth.com/mod/bundle-backportish) by [The Potato Archivist](https://modrinth.com/user/ThePotatoArchivist) (MIT)
